abstract = {Temporal characterization of a laser pulse is an essential task in many applications. Temporal characterization methods that are currently available support only a limited spectral bandwidth without information on the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the laser pulse or require complicated equipment in a vacuum environment. Here we demonstrate that an arbitrary time-dependent laser field can be directly sampled using subcycle tunneling ionization in a gaseous medium or in air. The subcycle ionization is used as a fast temporal gate for the direct sampling of the laser field. This unique approach enables the complete temporal characterization of the laser field, including its CEP, for a broad spectral range in ambient air, providing a universal tool for the precise measurement of the laser field.},
