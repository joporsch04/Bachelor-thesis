For retrieving ionisation rates, there are different ways of calculating the rates.\\
In this chapter I will explain some concepts and methods that are used to calculate the ionisation rates and what to do with them, how to verify them and so on.

\section{SFA Python Implementation}
The implementation of formula ?? was being done in python. Most of the implementation was already done by the Authors of \cite{Theory_NPS}.
The only part missing in the implementation was the extension to excited states. 
For that, major difficulty arrises from the fact that we now need the coefficients $c_n(t)$ of the state before ionization.

\subsection{Coefficients}
In theory, $|c_n(t)|^2$ or the amplitude of the coefficients is observable quantity and can be measured in experiment.
It tells us how propable the system is to be in a certain state $n$ at time $t$.
Furthermore, and most importantly, they are gauge independent. 
But since SFA is gauge dependent theory, and now we are not even dealing with the amplitude instead the complex coefficients, we need to be extremely careful with the gauge.

\subsection{Dipole matrix Elements}
Veery corse approximation since states are not plane waves in reality. Calculated in \ref{sec:dipolematrixelements}.

\section{TIPTOE}
TIPTOE \cite{Park:18} is a sampling method used for sub femtosecond processes. It is relevant for this thesis because it was used to verify the results from the Ionization model. 
TIPTOE is great because its fundamentals are very simple but it can tell you a lot about the dynamics in attosecond regime. 

\subsection{Time reversal symmetry}
TIPTOE -> we found out time reversal symmetry is violated. Normally TRS comes from ...
