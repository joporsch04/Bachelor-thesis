What motivates this thesis? Background: developement of SFA and GASFIR rates that doesnt have to numerically solve Schroedinger equation.
Comparison of ion rates from tRecX, SFA and GASFIR. When the laser pulse is an even function in time, the SFA rate is that as well. 
But numerical simulations from tRecX tell us thats not the case and the time symmetry is broken. Idea: because of the neglected excitedt states in SFA.
This brings up more questions: What role play excited states in ionization? Does the stark effect play an important role?
