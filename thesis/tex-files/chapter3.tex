\section{TIPTOE}
TIPTOE \cite{Park:18} is a sampling method used for sub femtosecond processes. It is relevant for this thesis because it was used to verify the results from the Ionization model. 
TIPTOE is great because its fundamentals are very simple but it can tell you a lot about the dynamics in attosecond regime. 

\subsection{Time reversal symmetry}
TIPTOE -> we found out time reversal symmetry is violated. Normally TRS comes from ...
