The main reason for making these ionization models is because one want to avoid solveng the schroedinger equation numerically because its time consuming and contains numerical difficulties.
However, for comparing and verifying the models, one needs to solve it numerically.
Especially for expanding an already existing model, it is important to compare and see if the changes of the model are going into the right direction.

I need to check if trecx coeff are trustable, use pertubation theory first order, for n>>1 trecx should predict different results because pert theory is not valid anymore\\
I also need to check how often I have to write the coefficients to the expec file. That depends on the characterisitc time of the state and on the frequency of the laser of course.\\
in E4 it was easy because laser had cosine shape. attosecond physics not the case, more a lase pulse, cos8 envelope so it doesnt make much sense to speak of rabi oszillations.\\
Difference between length gauge and velocity gauge in numerics\\
Why is it so diffficult? Solving time dependent Schroedinger euation numerically is not that hard. But in attosecond regime electron in Hydrogen likes length gauge because everything can be defined by giving the position of the electron. 
But a free electron in a strong laser pulse really likes velocity gauge because everything can be described by the kinetic energy of the electron.\\
Since we dont know how trecx outputs the coefficients (in which pciture) we need to check that.
