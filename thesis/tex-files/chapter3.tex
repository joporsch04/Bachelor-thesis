The main reason for making these ionization models is because one want to avoid solveng the schroedinger equation numerically because its time consuming and contains numerical difficulties.
However, for comparing and verifying the models, one needs to solve it numerically.\\
Furthermore, numerically solving the TDSE is just good for ionization propabilities and not rates.\\
Especially for expanding an already existing model, it is important to compare and see if the changes of the model are going into the right direction.

\section{Numerical Methods}
To implement formula \ref{eq:smatrix} we need to solve the TDSE in two different ways numerically in order to obtain the coefficients $c_n(t)$. 
For that I used two different methods (tRecX and ODE) each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
Further, there is this dilemma with ionization rates not being quantum mechaincal observables, so we need to have trustfull ionization propabilities to compare my results.



\subsection{tRecX}
tRecX is a C++ code for solving generalized inhomogeneous time-dependent
Schroedinger-type equations in arbitrary dimensions and in a variety of coordinate systems \cite{Scrinzi_trecx}.
Usually ionization is difficult for an numerical solver because the electron "leaves" the subspace of the bound states, making the calculations very time consuming.
tRecX uses different techniques (irECS and tSURFF) making it especially suitable for light atom interaction. 
Further, tRecX allows to specify the gauge in which the TDSE is solved, making it more flexible. 
This will be important later.

\subsection{ODE}
To acess the coefficients of the wavefunction inside the subspace of the bound states I used the interaction picture and the coupled system of differential equations. 
To implement the calculation I used Python and the ODE solver from SciPy integrate called \texttt{solve\_ivp}.
For initial values I choosed \texttt{c\_n(0) = 1} for the ground state and \texttt{c\_n(0) = 0} for all other states.
The code can be found in the electronic appendix in the class \texttt{HydrogenSolver}.
For more details about the implementation, see chapter 4.

\section{TIPTOE}
This mostly follows \cite{Park:18} and \cite{manorammasterthesis}.
\paragraph{Why do we need TIPTOE?} 
In order to verify the ionization rates determined by the models, we need to compare it with something that is experimentally accessible.
However an ionization rate is not a quantum mechanical observable, we can only measure the ionization yield so $\int \Gamma(t) \dd t$.

In some way, TIPTOE motivates this thesis, since TIPTOE's results showed us the break in time reversal symmetrie mentioned earlier.
But what is TIPTOE? TIPTOE \cite{Park:18} is short for tunneling ionization with a perturbation for the time-domain observation of an electric field. 
It is used for direct sampling an electric pulse in the femtosecond to attosecond regime using quasistatic subcycle tunneling ionization in a gaseous medium or air.
Tunneling ionization differes from multiphoton ionization in the sense that the laser field is so strong that it deforms the coulomb barrier of the atom, allowing the electron to tunnel through it.
However, our motivation to establish an instantanious ionization rate remains promising, especially because in the models that describe tunneling ionization, the ionization rate only depends on the field strength of the laser pulse.

% complex atoms and of atomic ions in an alternating electromagnetic
% field,” Sov. Phys. JETP 64, 1191–1194 (1986).

% Sov. Phys. JETP 20, 1307 (1965).
A typical TIPTOE simulation consist of two linear polarised lase pulses, a "fundamental" and a "signal" pulse, similar to common pump-probe experiments. 
The drive pulse is the pulse we want to sample at the end just by measuren the ionization yield for a certain medium.
In the first order we can approximate the ionization rate as
\begin{equation*}
    \Gamma(E_{\mathrm{F}}+E_{\mathrm{S}})=\Gamma(E_{\mathrm{F}})+\left.E_{\mathrm{S}}\frac{\dd \Gamma(E_{\mathrm{S}})}{\dd E}\right|_{E=E_{\mathrm{F}}}
\end{equation*}
However in this approximation we are going to neglect the depletion of the ground state. 
Then the total ionisation yield $N$ obtained by the two pulses is given by
\begin{equation*}
    N_{\mathrm{total}}=N_0+\delta N = \int \dd t\,\Gamma(E_{\mathrm{F}}(t))+\int \dd t\,E_{\mathrm{S}}(t)\left.\frac{\dd \Gamma(E_{\mathrm{S}}(t))}{\dd E}\right|_{E=E_{\mathrm{F}}(t)}
\end{equation*}
By changing the delay $\tau$ between the two pulses, the ionization yield of course different values.
With this we can find that:
\begin{equation*}
    \delta N(\tau)\propto E_{\mathrm{S}}(\tau)
\end{equation*}
so we can sample the field amplitude of the signal pulse by measuring the ionization yield for different delays.
The TIPTOE method can be applied for the broad spectral range of the signal pulse, as long as the fundamental pulse is shorter than $1.5$ optical cycles.\\\\
Now we have a method to compare both ways and egt insight in the dynamics of the electron. 
This method is very usefull because the problem of numerical simulations giving good predicitons about ionization propabilities and analytical models about ionization rates.
Making a TIPTOE simulation can help to "reconstruct" the ionization dynamics which is particulary usefull in the context of this thesis.
We will later integrate the ionization rate of $E_{\mathrm{F}}+E_{\mathrm{S}}$ over the full time domain and compare the ionization yield for different delay with the resluts from the numerical solution of the TDSE.
The results of the TIPTOE simulation from the numerical solution of the TDSE (tRecX) compared to the approximative methods (variations of SFA) are shown in the figures in chapter 5.
To have a better view on the actual physics in TIPTOE I subtracted the "background" ionization from $E_F(t)$ and normalized the ionization yield so the formula in plot ???? reads
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{N_{\mathrm{total}}-N_0}{N_{\mathrm{max}}}=\frac{\delta N(\tau)}{N_{\mathrm{max}}}
\end{equation*}
Nevertheless, one can also find some interesting physics by just comparing the net ionization yield $N_{\mathrm{total}}$ but later in chapter 5.\\\\
Usually TIPTOE is not used for this kind of analysis, rather for the sampling aspect.
This makes instantanious ionization rates are so usefull because with TIPTOE it allows to sample the electric field of a laser pulse in the femtosecond to attosecond regime which has of course a broad range of applications for instance in laser spectroskopy or medical physics.

\section{GASFIR}
GASFIR is short for general approximator for strong field ionization rates.
It is an analytical retrieval tool for reconstructing data obtaned from numerical solutions of the TDSE. 
It was validated for hydrogen and shows good agreement with existing theories in the quasi static limit of tunneling ionization not only for Hydrogen, also for Helim and Neon [cite GASFIR].
The way how GASFIR works is that it uses ionization probabilities to retrieve ionization rates. 
It uses the idea from SFA that the rates can be written as $\int \dd T K(t,T)$ with $K(t,T)$ being a kernel function.
Later in the code you see also the kernel function, where the modifications happened. 
Its not really part of this thesis, but motivates it.
Goal: make GASFIRs predictions better by improving SFA rates
